                            on hospital network security. My research looks at

                            healthcare are used and can be improved. During my
                            PhD, I've worked closely with clinicians, network
                            operators, and device manufacturers to understand
                            their operating environments and ensure my research

                            lot of personal information here. Aren't you worried
                            about this being used for social engineering
                            purposes?". Sure, we need to be aware of and control
                            the flow of information about ourselves online. My
                            threat model accounts for this, and the benefits of
                            sharing this information outweigh the cons. You can

                            Before embarking on my Ph.D., I wore several different hats in a
                            variety of industries. I've spent the past decade
                            working in various positions related to behavioural
                            science. I have experience in capital markets,
                            defence, and politics. Some highlights include:
                            co-founding a startup that developed technology
                            augmenting situational awareness for Army Special
                            Forces, studying portfolio manager behaviour at a
                            prominent hedge fund (before joining a portfolio
                            team), helping political campaigns with
                            microtargeting using digital and offline data,
                            and coordinating the cybersecurity for a
                            presidential campaign. I went to university with the
                            impression that politics was like the West Wing and

                            securitization regulations such as Dodd-Frank and the

                        My current research explores the critical intersection
                        of security and patient care in healthcare environments.
                        I'm examining the potential impact of cyberattacks on
                        medical devices and how security measures can affect the
                        delivery of patient care. This research, combining
                        qualitative interviews with a large-scale survey of
                        medical professionals, aims to inform the development of
                        security solutions that prioritize both patient safety
                        and the integrity of healthcare systems.

                        My research delves into the practical application of
                        threat modeling, particularly within the challenging
                        landscape of medical device security. I've explored the
                        gap between theoretical threat modeling methodologies
                        and how experts actually work, uncovering the fluid and
                        iterative nature of their processes. This research,
                        focused on the unique security needs of medical devices,
                        has led to the development of tools designed to better
                        support real-world threat modeling workflows.

                    <li style="margin-left: 25px">
                        I investigate the complexities of vulnerability
                        assessment and management, especially within the context
                        of medical devices and hospital networks. My work
                        analyzes how vulnerability severity is assessed in
                        practice, examining the consistency and variability of
                        scoring systems. This research aims to provide insights
                        for improving vulnerability triage processes in
                        healthcare settings, ensuring resources are focused on
                        the most critical risks.

                    My research is driven by a deep commitment to securing
                    healthcare's future. It sits at the critical intersection of
                    cybersecurity,

                    >, and, most importantly, human factors, specifically within
                    the context of medical devices and healthcare settings. It's
                    not enough to build technically sound security solutions if
                    they don't fit the real-world workflows and needs of the
                    medical professionals and patients who rely on them. I'm
                    fascinated by how we can empower security personnel and
                    healthcare providers with the right tools and processes,
                    ensuring security becomes a force multiplier for safety and
                    reliability in healthcare, not a burdensome obstacle that
                    compromises patient care. My work focuses on understanding
                    why securing complex healthcare systems is so difficult, and
                    then translating those insights into practical, usable
                    solutions that prioritize both security and patient safety.
                    This means I immerse myself in the problem space – from
                    interviewing security experts, open-source developers, and
                    medical professionals to participating in specialized
                    cybersecurity training – to truly grasp the challenges on
                    the ground within the healthcare ecosystem.

                        <p>
                            When applying for academic jobs, you are required to
                            provide statements on your research and teaching
                            philosophies. Providing a general professional
                            philosophy statement that drives my decision-making
                            is essential. Maybe this is the self-centered
                            Millennial in me that needs validation, or the

                        <p>
                            I've spent a fair amount of time working with the

                            want to make sure that my work delivers on my

                        <h3>Tikkun olam</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Judaism, we refer to a concept called "tikkun
                            olam," which literally means repairing the world.
                            Over time, this has grown, and for many now
                            signifies a calling to a higher purpose and to do
                            good in the world. My hope is that my work
                            positively impacts society by minimizing security
                            risks.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Do no harm</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've been on the front lines of figuring out how to
                            leverage social media to influence voters when I was
                            working in politics. The weaponization of social
                            media, especially by foreign threat actors, has
                            motivated me to spend time thinking about my role in
                            this, and I strive to ensure that my work does not
                            cause undue harm, or at the very least that I
                            acknowledge the potential for harm.
                        </p>

                            One of my most influential mentors,

                            >, told me that good design begets adoption, and
                            more importantly, lousy design will definitely kill
                            it. He also introduced me to Ruby, whose design
                            philosophy is to make programmers happy. While most
                            of my software is written in Python, I consider this
                            when designing APIs and User Interfaces.

                            My background colour is Black, a standard colour
                            that best contrasts my text and pays homage to the
                            beginning of my career, which I spent in the dark in
                            a beleaguered attempt to minimize server exhaust
                            heat.

                            White is my primary text colour as it is clean and
                            precise, while Warm Grey 40 is used for section
                            headers.

                            and site navigation. The colour echoes my work with

                            promoting good health (security and otherwise).

                            >, the secondary school where I started rowing. The
                            story behind the school using this colour is that
                            Westminster and Eton, another prominent independent
                            school in the UK, competed in a rowing race to wear
                            red, representing the monarchy, in 1837. The
                            Westminster eight won, but their uniforms had been
                            dyed right before the race, and by the end, the dye
                            had bled to pink. Because of the unexpected victory,
                            the school decided pink must be lucky, and the
                            colour was adopted. Since my time at Westminer, I've
                            always thought of pink as a lucky colour.
