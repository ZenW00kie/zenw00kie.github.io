                            Before embarking on my Ph.D., I wore several different hats in a
                            variety of industries. I've spent the past decade
                            working in various positions related to behavioural
                            science. I have experience in capital markets,
                            defence, and politics. Some highlights include:
                            co-founding a startup that developed technology
                            augmenting situational awareness for Army Special
                            Forces, studying portfolio manager behaviour at a
                            prominent hedge fund (before joining a portfolio
                            team), helping political campaigns with
                            microtargeting using digital and offline data,
                            and coordinating the cybersecurity for a
                            presidential campaign. I went to university with the
                            impression that politics was like the West Wing and
                            I wanted to be

                        >critical infastructure</a
                    >, and, most importantly, human factors, specifically within the context of medical devices and healthcare settings.  It's not enough to build technically sound security solutions if they don't fit the real-world workflows and needs of the medical professionals and patients who rely on them. I'm fascinated by how we can empower security personnel and healthcare providers with the right tools and processes, ensuring security becomes a force multiplier for safety and reliability in healthcare, not a burdensome obstacle that compromises patient care.  My work focuses on understanding why securing complex healthcare systems is so difficult, and then translating those insights into practical, usable solutions that prioritize both security and patient safety.  This means I immerse myself in the problem space – from interviewing security experts, open-source developers, and medical professionals to participating in specialized cybersecurity training – to truly grasp the challenges on the ground within the healthcare ecosystem.

                <p>
                    A core area of my research explores threat modeling, a crucial process for designing secure systems, especially within the highly regulated and safety-critical domain of medical devices.  While established threat modeling methods exist, my work reveals that practitioners, particularly those working with medical devices, often deviate from these formal processes in practice.  My USENIX Security 2024 paper, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/thompson">"There are rabbit holes I want to go down that I’m not allowed to go down: An Investigation of Security Expert Threat Modeling Practices for Medical Devices,”</a> delved into the real-world threat modeling practices of medical device security experts. Through in-depth interviews, I discovered that these experts don't follow a rigid, sequential process. Instead, they fluidly switch strategies, often leveraging use cases and grappling with the integration of safety considerations – aspects largely overlooked in existing threat modeling methodologies. This research, focused specifically on the unique challenges of medical device security, led to the development of the <a href="https://github.com/tufts-tsp/tmnt">Threat Modeling Naturally Tool</a>, presented at the Workshop for Security Information Workers 2024. This interactive tool aims to support the more flexible and ad-hoc ways that threat modeling actually happens, bridging the gap between theory and practice within the medical device context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expanding on this theme, I'm also a secondary author on a forthcoming USENIX Security paper, “'Threat modeling is very formal, it’s very technical, and also very hard to do correctly': Investigating Threat Modeling Practices in Open-Source Software Projects.”  While this work examines open-source software in general, the insights gained are relevant to the broader software ecosystem, including the software components often integrated into medical devices.  This research investigates the threat modeling practices of open-source developers, revealing that due to time constraints and perceived limited benefits, most resort to ad-hoc approaches.  Our work provides recommendations to better support threat modeling within the open-source community, recognizing the unique challenges they face, which can also inform best practices for securing medical device software supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond threat modeling, I'm also interested in vulnerability assessment and management, particularly as it relates to the secure operation of medical devices and hospital networks.  My paper under review, “A Patchwork of Sources: A Large-scale Evaluation of CVSS Availability and Variance in Practice,” examines the real-world application of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).  By analyzing a massive dataset of CVSS assessments, I'm investigating the variability and consistency of vulnerability severity scores in practice, providing insights for network operators and hospital security teams to improve their vulnerability triage processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, my research is deeply focused on the intersection of security and patient care within healthcare settings. Through in-depth interviews with medical providers, I'm investigating the potential impact of different types of cyberattacks (focused on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) on medical devices, as well as how existing security controls might inadvertently impede patient care.  This qualitative research, specifically tailored to the healthcare context, is being followed up with a large-scale survey of over 500 medical professionals in the US, Canada, and the UK to quantify their perceptions of the likelihood and potential harm associated with these attack scenarios.  This work aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the risks facing healthcare systems and inform the development of more effective and usable security solutions that prioritize both the security and safety of patients.

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            When applying for academic jobs, you are required to provide statements on your research and teaching philosophies. Providing a general professional philosophy statement that drives my decision-making is essential. Maybe this is the self-centered Millennial in me that needs validation, or the influence of my mother who <a href="https://annebahrthompson.com/brand-citizenship-purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helps brands find their purpose</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Mission-Oriented</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've spent a fair amount of time working with the military and veterans in various organisations. <a href="https://wearefirstin.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renny McPherson</a>, a veteran and professional mentor, always talks to me about the importance of being driven by the mission. I've internalised this over the years and want to make sure that my work delivers on my personal mission <i>to enable operators to focus on their mission by <span>making security a force multiplier for safety and reliability</span></i>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Tikkun olam</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Judaism, we refer to a concept called "tikkun olam," which literally means repairing the world. Over time, this has grown, and for many now signifies a calling to a higher purpose and to do good in the world. My hope is that my work positively impacts society by minimizing security risks.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Do no harm</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've been on the front lines of figuring out how to leverage social media to influence voters when I was working in politics. The weaponization of social media, especially by foreign threat actors, has motivated me to spend time thinking about my role in this, and I strive to ensure that my work does not cause undue harm, or at the very least that I acknowledge the potential for harm.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Good design is integral</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of my most influential mentors, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottriding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scotty Riding</a>, told me that good design begets adoption, and more importantly, lousy design will definitely kill it. He also introduced me to Ruby, whose design philosophy is to make programmers happy. While most of my software is written in Python, I consider this when designing APIs and User Interfaces.

                        <p>
                            I want to acknowledge where the inspiration for my website's design comes from.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Fonts</h3>
                        <p>
                            My main text font is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Plex&reg;</a>. I selected IBM Plex because of IBM's design goal of representing the medium between man and machine, which is similar to my goal of translating between technical and non-technical audiences. My headings use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hammersmith+One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hammersmith One</a>, which is derived from the Johnston typeface (the font used by <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/suppliers-and-contractors/font-requests?intcmp=5840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transport for London</a>) and a nod to my childhood taking the Tube.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
                        <div class="color-grid" style="margin-left: 40px;">
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#000000">&ensp;Black (#000000)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ada8a8; color: #000000">&ensp;Warm Grey 40 (#ada8a8)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ec6602">&ensp;Healthy Orange (#ec6602)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#FFC0CB; color: #000000">&ensp;Pink (#fc89ac)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ffffff; color: #000000;">&ensp;White (#ffffff)</div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My background colour is Black, a standard colour that best contrasts my text and pays homage to the beginning of my career, which I spent in the dark in a beleaguered attempt to minimize server exhaust heat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            White is my primary text colour as it is clean and precise, while Warm Grey 40 is used for section headers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My favourite colour is orange, and I chose Healthy Orange from <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/company/brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siemens Healthineers</a> to emphasize important ideas, delineate sections, and site navigation. The colour echoes my work with medical device manufacturers, and is associated with promoting good health (security and otherwise).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, my links are underlined in pink, used by <a href="https://www.westminster.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westminster School</a>, the secondary school where I started rowing. The story behind the school using this colour is that Westminster and Eton, another prominent independent school in the UK, competed in a rowing race to wear red, representing the monarchy, in 1837. The Westminster eight won, but their uniforms had been dyed right before the race, and by the end, the dye had bled to pink. Because of the unexpected victory, the school decided pink must be lucky, and the colour was adopted. Since my time at Westminer, I've always thought of pink as a lucky colour.
