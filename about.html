                                I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at
                                Tufts University, advised by Daniel Votipka. My
                                research advances usable security and systems
                                security in healthcare and other critical
                                infrastructures, focusing on hospital network
                                security, medical device security, threat
                                modeling, and vulnerability management.

                                My first-author publications span both usable
                                security and systems security: USENIX Security,
                                IEEE SecDev, and SOUPS, with additional projects
                                under review at ACM CHI and USENIX Security.
                                These works cover clinician-centered security,
                                cybersecurity-informed consent, inconsistencies
                                in vulnerability advisory practices, and the
                                design of new threat modeling tools and
                                processes.

                                Beyond academia, I collaborate with hospitals,
                                device manufacturers, and regulators, and I have
                                contributed to ARPA-H and Cisco-funded
                                initiatives. Prior to graduate study, I gained

                        <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Mission-Oriented</h3>
                    <p>
                        My time working with military and veteran organisations
                        instilled in me the importance of being mission-driven.
                        I have internalised this over the years, ensuring that
                        my work delivers on my personal mission:
                        <i
                            >to enable clinicians to focus on delivering patient
                            care by making security a force multiplier for
                            safety and reliability</i
                        >. It's not just about solving a technical problem; it's
                        about achieving a tangible, positive outcome.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tikkun Olam</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Judaism, the concept of "tikkun olam"—literally,
                        "repairing the world"—serves as a call to a higher
                        purpose. For me, this translates into a professional
                        commitment to do good in the world. I hope that my work
                        positively impacts society by minimising security risks
                        and, in turn, protecting the people who rely on critical
                        systems.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Pragmatic Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my most influential mentors impressed upon me
                        that good design begets adoption, and, more importantly,
                        that poor design will surely kill it. This principle
                        guides my approach to creating security solutions.
                        Whether I am designing an API or a user interface, I
                        believe that usability and practicality are paramount.
                        Security measures, after all, are only effective if they
                        are properly implemented and used.

                    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The world's first webcam was
                    invented not with a grand vision of connecting the globe,
                    but out of a desperate need to avoid disappointment. In
                    1991, computer scientists at Cambridge University, tired of
                    walking to their break room only to find an empty coffee
                    pot, pointed a camera at it and wrote a program to broadcast
                    the live image to their desktop computers, allowing them to
                    check the coffee level before making the trip.
