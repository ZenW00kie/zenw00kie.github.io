                                    Threat modeling is considered an essential
                                    first step for "secure by design"
                                    development. Significant prior work and
                                    industry efforts have created novel methods
                                    for this type of threat modeling, and
                                    evaluated them in various simulated
                                    settings. Because threat modeling is
                                    context-specific, we focused on medical
                                    device security experts as regulators
                                    require it, and "secure by design" medical
                                    devices are seen as a critical step to
                                    securing healthcare. We conducted 12
                                    semi-structured interviews with medical
                                    device security experts, having participants
                                    brainstorm threats and mitigations for two
                                    medical devices. We saw these experts do not
                                    sequentially work through a list of threats
                                    or mitigations according to the rigorous
                                    processes described in existing methods and,
                                    instead, regularly switch strategies. Our
                                    work consists of three major contributions.
                                    The first is a two-part process model that
                                    describes how security experts 1) determine
                                    threats and mitigations for a particular
                                    component and 2) move between components.
                                    Second, we observed participants leveraging
                                    use cases, a strategy not addressed in prior
                                    work for threat modeling. Third, we found
                                    that integrating safety into threat modeling
                                    is critical, albeit unclear. We also provide
                                    recommendations for future work.

                                        Threat modeling (a specific session) is
                                        a non-linear process in many cases so
                                        you can start with a threat or
                                        mitigation (rather than sequentially
                                        working through the four questions -
                                        what am I building, what can go wrong,
                                        what am I doing about it, did I do a
                                        good enough job).

                                        Using use-cases (especially the critical
                                        clinical ones) to analyze threats and
                                        mitigations is a good jumping off point,
                                        rather than doing STRIDE-by-Element etc.
