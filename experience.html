                        <p>
                            Before beginning my PhD, I spent eight years working
                            in data science, quantitative finance, and national
                            security. This experience directly informs and
                            motivates my current research, grounding it in the
                            practical challenges of real-world operational
                            environments.

                        <p>
                            Worked with clients to build threat models and
                            create security artifacts for medical device
                            manufacturers to support FDA/EU regulatory
                            submissions, applying frameworks like
                            <code>NIST 800-30</code> and
                            <code>AAMI TIR57</code>. I also co-developed and
                            conducted a threat modeling training workshop
                            tailored for medical device manufacturers and
                            supported the company's Vulnerability Management as

                        <p>
                            Co-founded a middleware software company focused on
                            situational awareness and sensor fusion for a
                            Counter-UAS platform. The project began through the
                            National Security Innovation Network's Hacking for
                            Defense Program in partnership with USASOC. My role
                            was twofold: I led business operations while also
                            developing the core data processing pipeline using
                            <code>Python</code>, <code>Docker</code>,
                            <code>Redis</code>, <code>ELK</code>, and
                            <code>RabbitMQ</code> to ingest and fuse sensor data
                            for predictive threat models. After we were unable
                            to secure additional funding, we successfully
                            transferred our prototype to USASOC and DEVCOM.

                    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The term "bug" to describe a flaw
                    in a computer system was popularised by U.S. Navy Rear
                    Admiral Grace Hopper in 1947. After her team found a moth
                    stuck in a relay, physically impeding the operation of the
                    Harvard Mark II computer, they taped the insect to the
                    logbook with the note: "First actual case of bug being
                    found."
