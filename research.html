                            My research bridges the gap between the theoretical
                            and the practical, combining rigorous academic
                            inquiry with a deep understanding of real-world
                            operational and policy constraints. I focus on
                            developing security solutions that are not only
                            technically sound but also usable, effective, and
                            aligned with the strategic objectives of
                            organisations in critical sectors.

                                        In the high-stakes environment of
                                        healthcare, security measures must
                                        enhance, not hinder, clinical workflows.
                                        My research in this area focuses on
                                        understanding the security perceptions
                                        and practices of clinicians through
                                        multi-national studies. By identifying
                                        the friction points between existing
                                        security controls and the realities of
                                        patient care, I develop actionable
                                        recommendations for designing and
                                        implementing security solutions that are
                                        both effective and empathetic to the
                                        needs of healthcare professionals. This
                                        work also extends to patients, examining
                                        how they weigh abstract cybersecurity
                                        risks against concrete clinical benefits
                                        in the context of informed consent for
                                        connected medical devices.

                                        Effective security must be baked in, not
                                        bolted on. My research focuses on the
                                        real-world application of
                                        secure-by-design principles, with a
                                        particular emphasis on threat modeling.
                                        Through in-depth qualitative studies
                                        with industry practitioners, my work
                                        deconstructs how security experts
                                        actually approach design analysis,
                                        revealing a more natural, ad-hoc
                                        workflow than what is prescribed by
                                        standard methodologies. These insights
                                        have led to the development of the
                                        Threat Modeling Naturally Tool (TMNT), a
                                        first-of-its-kind platform designed to
                                        support a more intuitive and effective
                                        approach to building secure systems from
                                        the ground up.

                                        My background in government and national
                                        security provides a unique lens through
                                        which I view the challenges of
                                        cybersecurity. I believe that effective
                                        security is not just a technical
                                        problem, but a strategic one, deeply
                                        intertwined with policy, regulation, and
                                        organisational behaviour. My work seeks
                                        to inform the development of more
                                        effective security policies and
                                        strategies by grounding them in a deep
                                        understanding of the operational
                                        realities and human factors at play.
                                        Whether it's advising on regulatory
                                        frameworks for medical devices or
                                        developing strategies for securing
                                        critical infrastructure, my goal is to
                                        provide evidence-based guidance that is
                                        both pragmatic and impactful.

                    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The computer password was
                    invented at MIT in the 1960s, not for iron-clad security,
                    but as a polite way for multiple people to share one giant
                    computer. This new-fangled security was immediately proven
                    to be less than stellar when, in 1962, a Ph.D. student who
                    wanted more computer time simply printed the entire password
                    file. He then shared the list with friends, one of whom
                    began logging into the lab director's account to leave
                    "taunting messages."
